Chittabook - An app for tracking expense and income tracking
CS50W Final Project

Chitta Book is a personal finance management system that helps users track their expenses, set financial goals, and make informed decisions. The project is designed to be user-friendly, mobile responsive.

The project utilizes the following front end and back end web technologies:
1. Django (backend)
2. HMTL5
3. Bootstrap (for beautiful and mobile responsive templates)
4. Javascript (for functionality like changing text colors based on values)
5. JQuery (just for fun!)
6. HTMX (for navigating web application pages without reload)
